Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The goal of this application was to create an application that allowed a user to log into an app with a username and password. The application features an inventory application that allows a user to add, remove, and update an item, and then display the item. Lastly, the application needs to ask a user for permission to send an SMS text during login to allow a user to log in to their created account. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
There were 4 total screens in this application screen 1 was the login screen, and screen two was the home page, allowing users to choose to add an item and also view inventory. Screen 3 was the add item screen, the add item screen asked for an item number, price, quantity, and location of the item. The 3rd screen was the inventory screen, which allowed the user to view all the inventory, and lastly, the edit item screen, the edit item screen allowed a user to update and change items in inventory, along with delete. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I originally approached the application using flowcharts, I should have implemented a UI wireframe as well, so I could attach the UML and understand and code this project with ease. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
Ensuring proper testing of each method was essential to the productivity and integrity of the code. Using Logging functions to ensure the code hit each method and each input was essential to a function code.
